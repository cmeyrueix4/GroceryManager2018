# Personal Project

Created in December of 2018, this was the first project where I created something from start to finish. I was introduced to several OO design principles and learned to execute them with weekly deliverables. 


The purpose of this program was to allow the user to keep track of their grocery list as well as what was in their respective storage spaces: cupboards, fridge, and freezer. This was to allow the user to know how much more capacity each of their spaces had.
